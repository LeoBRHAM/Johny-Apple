<h1>School Project</h1>
<h2>Francisconia</h2>
<p>So this school project I did in Humanities in the year 2016. This project was essentially a Tri-Mester long simulation in which me and two parters (Emilien and Ronan) established a civilization on a large plot of land during the middle ages. We were essentially overlords of our civilization. In the entirety of the class there were about 5 civilizations on different types on plots, one might be more mountainess then another while the other would have more farmland. Your plot mattered because you needed resources, and you were allowed to trade with other groups but that would cost you a lot of gold. Which reminds me, so you would start out with a certain amount of materials based on your plot along with 1000 gold. You would have to build farms to make food and built homes to house people who would then work the farms. So yeah it was pretty complicated, anyway our civilization was given a plot of land with A LOT of farmland, the most out of any group. So we were the controller of food, while our polulation remained stagnent other group's popultions boomed so they couldn't feed their people so we sold wheat to other groups at really high prices which allowed us to scale and grow. Soon we were the powerhouse of the game, we easily became the richest civilization. But then the rains happened, our Super Star Teacher Brian Luccett unleashed torrents of rain on all of our civilization destorying 50% of EVERYONES crops. But because our group had SO MUCH food, we had more then enough for our people, and since the other 4 groups were on their knees we stripped them of their gold and other resources in exchange for a fraction of our food surplus. So The End, we ended up as the overlords and puppet masters of the others nations. Happy Ending!</p>
