	<h1>Leo Braham 2044</h1>
	<h4>Leo Braham 2044 is a campaign to elect me to be President of the United States of America, our official campaign slogan is "A new American Era!" This is because our once beautiful nation is in a sorry state of despair. I want to be elected so I can serve the people and restore the United States of America back to it's glorius days. Because right now our nation is plagued by a monstrous national debt, high rates of poverty, low wage growth, and an increasingly partisian Supreme Court. I believe that with the right initiatives we can solve our problems and propel ourselves into an era of unprecedented prosperity.</h4> 
	
	<h1>LEO ON THE ISSUES</h1>
	<h1>National Debt</h1>
	<p>Our national debt is at a stagering $22,000,000,000,000. if we stacked up our entire national debt it would literally hit the moon, this issue cannot be ignored. Sooner or later the debt will catch up with the US government, and at best American Taxpayers will be hurt. And at worst the government may default on it's debt and crush the economy, make the unemployment rate skyrocket, and jeopardize American wealth. So if I am elected I will pass a constituitional amendmant that will require the legislator to save 15% of Federal Dollars to pay of the national debt until it is gone. This will also prompt the government to think about how it spends its money therfore stopping uneccesary spending.</p>

	<h1>National Security/Defense</h1>
	<p>The United States of America needs a strong military that can protect us and others from the threaths of foreign nations and terrorist groups. But we do not need to spend 55% of our annual budget ($750B) just on defense. So if elected I would cut spending down to a maximium of $600B. Cutting $150B of defense spending if justifiable because it will allow us to spend more on Space Exploration, Education, and different social programs. Also I think the US militay shouldn't retire "old" aircraft and instead sell them to other nations or keep them in service for a longer period of time. Additionally more defense dollars should be spend on R&D, this would allow for the US military to accelerate it's capabilities at an unprecedented level.</p>

	<h1>Trade</h1>
	<p>The US's trade deficit with China is at a staggering $400B, if elected I would immedietally work to close the deficit by lifting tariffs on Chinese goods and work with the Chinese government to have China buy more American goods. Also if elected President my administration would also work to achieve a free trade aggreement with the EU, and pursue other free trade agreements with other nations. And of course I would work to re-join the TPP, these policies are integral in getting the US economy to not only reach new heights but also increase wages and create more jobs for certain American communities.</p>

	<h1>Foreign Policy</h1>
	<p>Ever since Donald Trump took office, the US has began to back away from the world stage. So if elected president I would immediatly re-affirm the United States's committment to the World Order, this would create better ties with our counterparts at the United Nations and other multi-national bodies. Also I would work to improve the situations in South and Central America. For many years the US has largely neglected their closest neighbors, so I beleive we should work with governments to secure their nations and promote more diplomatic engagement through Trade, and other methods. This would create a better envirnment with our neighbors and allow us to build up struggling economies in South and Central America.</p>

	<h1>Energy and Climate</h1>
	<p>I believe that the enviornment is just as important as our military, so if elected I would increase the EPA's annual budget by 25%. This would allow for the United States to fight the looming dangers of Climate Change. Also I would require all American cities to run 50% on renewable energy and ban the purchase of non-electric vehicles.</p>

	<h1>Social Programs</h1>
	<p>If elected I would introduce a number of Social Programs, including ones allowing people to claim a $10,000 Universal Basic Income or UBI. UBI would work like this: If you are bellow the poverty line and working you would be able to claim a non-taxable income of $10K each year. You would continue to recieve this income for 5 years or until your income raises you out of poverty. However you must work at least 30 hours a week to be able to claim this income. This program would lift millions out of poverty and would bo ost GDP growth, and government revenue therfore making it financially viable. Funds for this program would be provided from additional government revenue from increased taxes.</p>

	<h1>Tax Reform</h1>
	<p>Our Tax system is a giant mess right now, although many people have pledged to fix it, none have succeeded. So if elected I would change the tax code to benefit the general public and the government. I would begin by created 7 tax tiers and tax each one differently depending on their income (single). I would raise taxes on richer Americans ($250,000-) and eliminate all federal taxes for people who make less then $12,000 each year. Also I would lower taxes for lower-middle America and un-cap the deductable limit. Additionally I would overhaul the corporate tax code. I would do this by changing the corporate tax rate by +15% making it 36%. However the code would exempt them from 10% of that tax if the company is based in the US and starts hourly wages at $14/hour for all US employees (adjusted to infaltion each year). This would incenivise corporations to increase wages, this would immediately increase the average American's spending power which would accelerate the American economy and increase federal income which could then be re-invested into the economy.</p>

	<h1>Education</h1>
	<p>The education system is the US is great on the outside but when you go deeper you start to see some major flaws in the system, underfunded schools, kids without lunches, and many other issues. This is why I would give the education deptartment a $80B annual budget a vast increase even before the Trump cuts. This extra money would be spent on school lunch programs and increased funding for Public School materials, like textbooks, and other classroom essentials along with free after school activies that kids can enjoy. Also I would eliminate all federal funding for School Choice and spend more money on STEM programs. Children are our future and if we want to be able to have the workforce of tommorow we need them educated today.</p>
